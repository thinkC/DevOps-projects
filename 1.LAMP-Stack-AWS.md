# Implementing LAMP Stack On AWS

## Launch Ubuntu AWS VM
 1. The first step in this project is to launch an Ubuntu Linux VM on AWS. Here I am using the free tier so as not to pay.

2. Create security Group . I called this `sg-pbl` and allowed `port 22` for `SSH` and port `80` for `HTTP`.

![Security Group](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img/img3.PNG?raw=true).

3. Created a Key pair and named it _mysingular-EC2_ . This is what I will later use to connect to the VM.

## Connect to VM using SSH

1. Copy the downloaded private key pair to a folder and change the ownerwhip to mysel and change permission tp full access to myself only

![privateKey-permission](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img/img9a.png?raw=true)
2. Open _Powershell_ and type the following code .Note that the Public IP address of the newly created VM is _18.234.169.112_ and username to login to the VM is _ubuntu_ . This public IP address will change on rebbot on shutdown of the server: 
```powershell
ssh -i C:\Users\Babatunde\Desktop\Downloads\pem\mysingular-EC2.pem ubuntu@18.234.169.112
```
![ssh-connection](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img/img8.PNG?raw=true "show hostname after connection")

## Installing Apache and Updating the Firewall

Apache is a web server software and host most of the worlds website. It is open source and free to use.

1. Install Apache using Ubuntu’s package manager ‘apt’:
First we will update the package manager. Type 'Yes' when prompted.
```bash
#update a list of packages in package manager
sudo apt update
#run apache2 package installation
sudo apt install apache2

```

![update package Manager](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img/img10.PNG?raw=true)
![install apache](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img/img10a.PNG?raw=true)

2. Verity that Apache is now running as a service on the OS

```bash
sudo systemctl status apache2
```
It shows green as seen below, which mean it is running. We have successfully launched our first web server running on the cloud!.

![check running service](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img/img10b.PNG?raw=true)

Since we already opened port 80 in our security group we can now test. First we check if we can access it locally on ubuntu with command below and we should have an html as our output.

```bash
curl http://localhost:80
```
Next, we test our Apache HTTP server on the browser by typing _http://18.234.169.112/_ the browser and we should get below.
![apache on the browser](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img/img10c.PNG?raw=true)

## Installing Mysql
We will be using [Mysql](https://www.mysql.com/, "Mysql"). It [relational database management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database, "RDMS") to store and manage our web server content.

First we install it using code below. Type _Yes_ when prompted.

```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server
```
After successfulling instaling _mysql_ it is best to run a security script that comes with _MYSQL_ . This will make our _MYSQL_ secure. After installing this it will prompt to _Validate Password_ . This is to make sure we have a strong password. So you can type _Yes or No_. For this project , I am typing _No_, but if we are in a production environment , it is recommented to type 'Yes'. Type _Yes_ for other prompts.

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

3. Next we test if we can logon to _MYSQL_ by typing below:

```bash
sudo mysql
```
We should see below output
![mysql login](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img/img10d.PNG?raw=true)

4. Type `exit` to exit mysql

## Installing PHP
We will install `php` .PHP helps to process our code to display dymnamic content . 
In addition to this we will also install `php-mysql` , This is a PHP _module that allows PHP to communicate with MySQL-based databases_, finally we we will install `libapache2-mod-php` which _enable Apache to handle PHP files_.

```bash
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
```
After successfulling installing them , we can check the version of PHP oinstalled with the code below.

```bash
php -v
```

The output shows below:
```powershell
PHP 7.2.24-0ubuntu0.18.04.7 (cli) (built: Oct  7 2020 15:24:25) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) 1997-2018 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.2.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2018 Zend Technologies
    with Zend OPcache v7.2.24-0ubuntu0.18.04.7, Copyright (c) 1999-2018, by Zend Technologies
```

We now have our LAMP stack installed and runing.

## Creating Virtual Host for our website using Apache

We will create an Apache virtual host our website files and folders. Virtual host allows us to have multiple website on a single machine without users noticing it.
For this project we will create a domain called `projectlamp`.
By default Apache on Ubuntu 20.04 has server block configured to serve documents from /var/www/html directory but we will leave this as it is and create our own. 

1. Create a directory for`projectlamp`
```bash
sudo mkdir /var/www/projectlamp
```
2. Assign ownership of the newly created directory to current syestem user 
```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/projectlamp
```
checking with `ls -l /var/www`
```bash

ubuntu@ip-172-31-60-110:~$ ls -l /var/www
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 root   root   4096 Apr 11 15:42 html
drwxr-xr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Apr 11 16:50 projectlamp
ubuntu@ip-172-31-60-110:~$
```
3. Create and open a new configuration file in Apache's `sites-available` directory using your preferred command-line editor . Here I'm using `nano`
```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/projectlamp.conf
```

Then paste the below code and save the editor.
```bash
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName projectlamp
    ServerAlias www.projectlamp 
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot /var/www/projectlamp
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
1. Paste the above code
2. Type ctrl O and Enter to save.
3. Type crtl X to exit.

![edit fiel with nano](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img/img10e.PNG?raw=true)

4. Use the ls command to show the new file in the sites-available directory.

```bash
sudo ls /etc/apache2/sites-available
```
You will see below:
```bash
000-default.conf  default-ssl.conf  projectlamp.conf
```
The VirtualHost configuration setup we did tells Apache to server the `projectlamp` using `/var/www/projectlampl` as its web root directory. To test the Apache without a domain name you will need to comment out or remove options for ServerName and ServerAlias.

5. Use a2ensite to enable teh new virtaul host.
```bash
sudo a2ensite projectlamp
```
This will output below:
```bash
Enabling site projectlamp.
To activate the new configuration, you need to run:
  systemctl reload apache2
```
Since we are using a custom domain name, it is necessary to diable the defaul Apache's website, else the Apache's website will overwrite out virtual host. 
6. Disable Apache's default website using command below:

```bash
sudo a2dissite 000-default
```
We get below output

```bash
Site 000-default disabled.
To activate the new configuration, you need to run:
  systemctl reload apache2
```
7. Test to make sure configuration file does noy have any erorr.

```bash
sudo apache2ctl configtest
```
We get below output

```bash
Syntax OK
```
8. Reload Apache, so that changes will be effected.

```bash
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```
The website is now up and running but the web root `/var/www/projectlamp` is empty. We will need to create a index.html file in that same location so we test teh virtual host works as expected.

9. Create indxt.html file.
```bash
sudo echo 'Hello LAMP from hostname' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname) 'with public IP' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4) > /var/www/projectlamp/index.html
```
10. Launch the website url in the browser . `http://18.234.169.112`

The output shows below echo in the index.html which means the website works
![index.html](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img/img10f.PNG?raw=true)

For now we can leave this index.html as a landing page of our website temporarily until we setup index.php to replace it. index.html file takes precedence over index.php, so this needs to be remaned

## Enable PHP on the website
Next we will make index.php the default page. To do this we will need to update the 
1. Make index.php default
`dir.conf` file.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf
```

```bash
We update the code to below, making `index.php` to come first
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
        #DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi index.pl index.php index.xhtml index.htm
        DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.cgi index.pl index.xhtml index.htm
</IfModule>
```
2. Reload Apache's web server
We then need to reload Apache's server
```bash
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```
3. Create a new file named index.php inside your custom web root folder:
We create a PHP script to test that PHP is correctly installed and configured on your server.

```bash
nano /var/www/projectlamp/index.php
```

We add code below
```bash
<?php
phpinfo();
```

After updating the index.php file we should see below:
