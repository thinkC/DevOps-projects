# Implementing LAMP Stack On AWS

## Launch Ubuntu AWS VM
 1. The first step in this project is to launch an Ubuntu Linux VM on AWS. Here I am using the free tier so as not to pay.

2. Create security Group . I called this `sg-pbl` and allowed `port 22` for `SSH` and port `80` for `HTTP`.

3. Created a Key pair and named it _mysingular-EC2_ . This is what I will later use to connect to the VM.

4. VM successfully launched and running.

## Connect to VM using SSH

1. Copy the downloaded private key pair to a folder and change the ownerwhip to mysel and change permission tp full access to myself only

2. Open _Powershell_ and type the following code .Note that the Public IP address of the newly created VM is _18.234.169.112_ and username to login to the VM is _ubuntu_ . This public IP address will change on rebbot on shutdown of the server: 
```powershell
ssh -i C:\Users\Babatunde\Desktop\Downloads\pem\mysingular-EC2.pem ubuntu@18.234.169.112
```

## Installing Apache and Updating the Firewall

Apache is a web server software and host most of the worlds website. It is open source and free to use.

1. Install Apache using Ubuntu’s package manager ‘apt’:
First we will update the package manager. Type 'Yes' when prompted.
```bash
#update a list of packages in package manager
sudo apt update
#run apache2 package installation
sudo apt install apache2

```

![install apache](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img/img10a.PNG?raw=true)

2. Verity that Apache is now running as a service on the OS

```bash
sudo systemctl status apache2
```
It shows green as seen below, which mean it is running. We have successfully launched our first web server running on the cloud!.

Since we already opened port 80 in our security group we can now test. First we check if we can access it locally on ubuntu with command below and we should have an html as our output.

```bash
curl http://localhost:80
```
Next, we test our Apache HTTP server on the browser by typing _http://18.234.169.112/_ the browser and we should get below.
