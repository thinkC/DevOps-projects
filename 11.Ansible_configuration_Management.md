# Automating task with Ansible and Jenkins

![image-title](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img-title-proj11.PNG?raw=true)

## Introduction

In this project, we shall be looking at how we can start to automate most of our routine tasks and writing our code with YAML. We shall be using our `Jenkins` server as a [Bastion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host) host. The reason for for this setup is that in a production envireonment, our web servers and DB servers are suppose to be in a private subnet while the Load Balancer will be in Public subnet. This means that only the Load Balancer will be reachable from the internet. So, you ask how then do we connect to our webservers and Database server?, and this is where Bastion Host sometimes called Jump Host comes in. It will serve as a intermediary between our connection and the servers in the private subnet as the Bastion Host will be placed in the public subnet.

## Step 1 - Install and Configure Ansible on EC2 Instance

We currently have the below setup
![servers](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-lb-nginx/img-serverlist.PNG?raw=true)

1. First we update the Name tag for our Jenkins server to be Jenkins-Ansible . This will be used to run playbooks.
2. We create a new repo named `ansible-config-mgt` on GitHub.
![github](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img2.PNG?raw=true)

<code>Note</code>: In other not to be changing our `Jenkins-Ansible` instance IP everytime we reboot or stop the instance since the IP address will change as a result, we will configure our instance to use an [Elastic IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html).

## Creating Elastic IP

1. Click on Elastic IP
2. Click on Allocate Elastic IP
3. Click Allocate . This then creates a static IP Address
4. Select the Elastic IP address that is allocated, click action and choose Associate Elastic IP
5. Next choose the EC2 instance you want to associate the Elastic IP with

![elastic IP](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img3.PNG?raw=true)
6. Click Associate.

![elastic IP](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img5.PNG?raw=true)

3. Install Ansible on the `Jenkins-Ansible` server.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
```
We check version of ansible installed.

`ansible --version`

output

```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-62-121:~$ ansible --version
ansible 2.9.6
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = ['/home/ubuntu/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  pytho
  n version = 3.8.10 (default, Jun  2 2021, 10:49:15) [GCC 9.4.0]
```
4. Next, we configure our Jenkins build job to save our repository content every time will make changes to our repo.
Next we do the following:
- we create a freestyle project named `ansible` and point it to our `ansible-config-mgt` repo.

![Ansible-freestyle](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img6.PNG?raw=true)

- Configure and set Webhook on GitHub to trigger ansible build. Notice we are using the Public Elastic IP.

![Ansible-freestyle](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img7.PNG?raw=true)

- Configure Post-Build Job to save all files.

Add Git repo link under Source Code Management

![Ansible-freestyle](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img8.PNG?raw=true)

Choose GitHub Hook Trigger
![Ansible-freestyle](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img9.PNG?raw=true)

Type `**` to archive all files and save.
![Ansible-freestyle](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img10.PNG?raw=true)

- Next test setup by making changes on the README.md file main Branch of the repository. If the setup is correct, the build should start automatically and Jenkins should save the files (build artifacts) in the folder path below.

`ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build_number>/archive/`.

`Note:` When I first made changes to my README.md file on the main branch, the build did not start automatically, when I did a manual build I got error below:

![Ansible-freestyle](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img12.PNG?raw=true).

On checking the internet, I found that since Jenkins new job configuration --> Source Code Management --> Git --> Branches to build -->
it is default to "/master" , this should be changed to "/main" since GitHub no longer use "master" as a branch name. Once this was updated build was automatically started after a change was initialed on teh main branch and was successful.

## Step 2 - Connect Visual studio code to Jenkins GitHub Repo

1. Connect to our ec2 instance `Jenkins-Ansible`.
2. Install git on the ubuntu server `sudo apt install git`
3. Clone the git repository 
`git clone https://github.com/thinkC/ansible-config-mgt.git`
 copy from GitHub
![Ansible-freestyle](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img18.PNG?raw=true)
Check folder

```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-62-121:~$ ls
ansible-config-mgt
```

4. To make setup and administration of our project easier we will be using Visual Studion code .We shall install remote SSH extensions so as to be able to connect to our `EC2 Jenkins-Anisble` instance and write our code in vscode . In VS Code install `Remote SSH`, `Remote SSH Editing` and `SSHExtension`.

Next, we setup configuration file by pressing `F1` on our keyboard and type and choose `Remote-SSH: Open Configuration file` and choose your folder.

Next, add Host, Hostname, User and IdentifyFile as below.

![remote-ssh](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img19.PNG?raw=true)

Press `F1` and type `Remote-SSH:Connect to Host`, it will display the name of the Host, in our own case `Jenkins-Ansible`, click it and will ask whick platform is the remote server, I choose Linux.

It will then open a new VS Code window and shows connected

![remote-ssh](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img20.PNG?raw=true)

Click open folder and click on `ansible-config-mgt` and click ok

![remote-ssh](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img21.PNG?raw=true)
We now see our READMe.md file and test folder. Ignore the test, I created earlier.

![remote-ssh](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img22.PNG?raw=true)


## Ansible Development

1. We will create a new branch named `proj11-ansible` on our `ansible-config-mgt` .
```bash
git checkout -b proj11-ansible
```

output

```bash
Switched to a new branch 'proj11-ansible'
```

<!-- ```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-62-121:~/ansible-config-mgt$ git checkout -b proj11-ansible
Switched to a new branch 'proj11-ansible'
ubuntu@ip-172-31-62-121:~/ansible-config-mgt$
``` -->
2. Create a directory named `playbooks` this will be used to store all our playbook files

`mkdir playbooks`
3. Create a directory and name it `inventory` this will be used to keep our hosts organized.
`mkdir inventory`
4. Create `common.yml` inside `playbooks`. This is our first playbook.
```bash
cd playbooks
touch common.yml
```
5. Inside inventory folder we create the following `.yml` inventory file for each environment (_Development_, _Staging_, Testing and Production)
as (`dev`, `staging`, `uat` (User Acceptance Testing), `prod`).

```bash
cd inventory/
touch dev.yml staging.yml uat.yml prod.yml
```

![anisble setup](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img23.PNG?raw=true)

## Setup - Ansible Inventory

Here, our task is to execute Linux command on remote hosts using Ansible.

Since Ansible uses SSH Port 22 by default, we will need to ssh into target servers from our `Jenkins-Ansible` ec2 instance which is our `Bastion` Host . We will require our private (.pem) and copy it to our `Jenkins-Ansible` server. When I mean copy , I don't meaning copying it using `cp` command but using `ssh agent`.

### Copy private key using SSH Agent

We will run below command on our `Jenkins-Ansible` server. This will allow us to be able to connect to other hosts from our `Jenkins-Ansible` server. I am doing this on my Local PC using Visual Studio Code.

```bash
Babatunde@DESKTOP-xxx ~/Project/Ansible/ansible-config-mgt (main)
$ eval `ssh-agent -s`
```
output
```bash
Agent pid 581
```

I later cd Downloads , here I have my private key and added the key, where `aws-bank-demo.pem` is my Private Key

```bash
Babatunde@DESKTOP-xxx ~/Desktop/Downloads
$ ssh-add -k aws-bank-demo.pem
Identity added: aws-bank-demo.pem (aws-bank-demo.pem)
```

```bash
$ ssh-add -l
```

output

```bash
2048 SHA256:Dut5uzpp+qWpTD6vJHxHjXG/IWoM3idey8L4dONTzy8 aws-bank-demo.pem (RSA)
```

Note: I changed the permission on my private key to 400, so as to be allowed on the reomte host.

run 

```bash
sudo chmod 400 aws-bank-demo.pem
```

```bash
-r-------- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1704 Jul 17 12:02 aws-bank-demo.pem
```

**Note**

While I connected to `Jenkins-Ansible` ec2 instance remotely form my Vs code , and ran `ssh-add -l` to get my Private Key , I got error `Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.`. So, I had to copy my Private key to my `Jenkins-Ansible`server and used `scp` command to copy to downnloads folder. I then ran the ssh agent command again as above to connect to all the servers first as a test and ran the Ansible file.

## Step 5 - Setup Ansible Inventory & Create A Commoon Playbook

Next we will add servers to the `inventory.yml` and in the `common.yml` file will contain
configuration for repeatable, re-useable and multi-machine tasks common to system in the infrastructure.
Add below to the `Inventory\inventory.yml` file.

```bash
[nfs]
<NFS-Server-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'

[webservers]
<Web-Server1-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'
<Web-Server2-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'

[db]
<Database-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user' 

[lb]
<Load-Balancer-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ubuntu'
```


```bash
[nfs]
172.31.51.147 ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'

[webservers]
172.31.54.139 ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'
172.31.63.137 ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'

[db]
172.31.52.115 ansible_ssh_user='ubuntu' 

[lb]
172.31.48.61 ansible_ssh_user='ubuntu'
```


Add below to the Ansible `Playbooks\common.yml` file

```bash
---
- name: update web, nfs and db servers
  hosts: webservers, nfs, db
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: ensure wireshark is at the latest version
    yum:
      name: wireshark
      state: latest

- name: update LB server
  hosts: lb
  remote_user: ubuntu
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: ensure wireshark is at the latest version
    apt:
      name: wireshark
      state: latest

```


## Step 6 - Update Git with latest code

Next, we will commit all our changes we made so far i.e. all the folders we have created _inventory_, _playbokoks_ and files to our new branch named `proj11-ansible`

Run command below to check status and new folders and files we created.

```bash
git status
git add .
```
![anisble setup](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img24.PNG?raw=true)

Notice, playbooks folder was not added because I was not in the root directory .

Adding Play books using its relative path

![anisble setup](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img26.PNG?raw=true)

Run `git commit -m "add mesage here"` as below to commit message to the staging area.

![anisble setup](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img27.PNG?raw=true)

Next, we need to merge this new changes to our `main` branch, we will need to `checkout` to main branch
Run code below to checkout to main branch

```bash
git checkout main
```

output

```bash
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

Run git status again to check

```bash
git status
```

output

```bash
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Merging  _proj11-ansible_
```bash
git merge proj11-ansible

```

output

```bash

 create mode 100644 playbooks/common.yml
 ```
Next, we push all our changes to GitHub

```bash
git push
```

output

```bash
Enumerating objects: 8, done.

```
We have all changes now on GitHub
![anisble setup](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img28.PNG?raw=true)

Once we have successfully pushed our changes to GitHub, Jenkins takes over and save all the files and folders to build artifacts on our `Jenkins-Ansible` server in this location `/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/6/archive/`
![anisble setup](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img29.PNG?raw=true) as seen below.


![anisble setup](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-ansible/img30.PNG?raw=true)

## Step 7 Run Ansible Test

Next we run the command below. Replace the <build-number> with your own build number.

```bash
ansible-playbook -i /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build-number>/archive/inventory/dev.yml /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build-number>/archive/playbooks/common.yml
```

```bash
ansible-playbook -i /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/6/archive/inventory/dev.yml /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/6/archive/playbooks/common.yml
```
output

```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-62-121:~/ansible-config-mgt$ ansible-playbook -i /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/8/archive/inventory/dev.yml /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/8/archive/playbooks/common.yml
