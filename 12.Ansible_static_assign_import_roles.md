# Anisble Refactoring & Static Assignments (Imports and Roles)

## Step 1 - Jenkins job enhancement

We will improve on Jenkins setup by creating another folder which will store all our artifacts, ther reason for this is because before now each time we make any new change in the code , it creates a seperate directory which will eventually consume space on the Jenkins server. We will use `Copy Artifact` plugin to achieve this.

1. On `Jenkins-Ansible` server, we create a directory named `ansible-config-artifact`. This will store all the artifacts after each build.

```bash
mkdir /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact
```
Next we change permission on this directory so that Jenkins can save files in it.

```bash
chmod -R 0777 /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact
```
2. Next we install the `Copy Artifact` plugin. On Jenkins web console -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugin -> Click Available Tab and search for `Copy Artifact`. Click install plugin without restarting Jenkins.

3. Create a new freestyle project and name it `save_artifacts`.

![ansible](./img-ansible/img34-p12.png)

Here we are keeping 2 of our build to conserve space . Number of build to keep can also be changed on the ansible job.

![ansible](./img-ansible/img35-p12.png)

Choose none under source code management

![ansible](./img-ansible/img36-p12.png)

![ansible](./img-ansible/img37-p12.png)

The `save_artifacts` project is to save artifacts into `/home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact`

Click on the Build Tab under Build choose `Copy artifacts from other project`

![ansible](./img-ansible/img38-p12.png)

![ansible](./img-ansible/img39-p12.png)

Testing our setup, we will make some change on the README.md file on the main branch inside `ansible-config-mgt` repository on GutHub . 

![ansible](./img-ansible/img40-p12.png)

Both Jenkins Jobs below, completed after the other

Now we see all our folders and files in `ansible-config-artifact` directory.

## Step 2 - Refactor Ansible code by importing other playboos into `site.yml`

<!-- Add Notes here -->

### Importing other playbooks
We login to `Jenkins-Ansible` and carry out the following:
1. Create `site.yml` file inside `playbooks` directory . File `site.yml` will now used as entry point for our entire infrastructure configuration and will server as parent for other playbooks including `common.yml` that we created in the last project.
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/playbooks
touch site.yml
```
2. Create a new folder in the root of the repository and name it `static-assignments`. We will store other children playbooks here. 
<!-- Note that this is for organizational purpose -->
```bash
mkdir static-assignments
```
3. We then move `common.yml` into `static-assignments` folder.

```bash
mv playbooks/common.yml static-assignments/ 
```
4. Inside `site.yml` file, `import common.yml` playbook

Add below to `site.yml`

```bash
---
- hosts: all
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common.yml

```

Now our folder structure should look like below

![ansible](./img-ansible/img44-p12.png)

Next we run Absible command on our dev environment to delete `wireshark` utility we installed in our last project. To do this, we create another playbook file inside `static-assignments` and name it `common-del.yml`.

```bash
cd static-assignments
touch common-del.yml
```
Then we add the code below to `del.yml`

```bash
---
- name: update web, nfs and db servers
  hosts: webservers, nfs, db
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: delete wireshark
    yum:
      name: wireshark
      state: removed

- name: update LB server
  hosts: lb
  remote_user: ubuntu
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: delete wireshark
    apt:
      name: wireshark-qt
      state: absent
      autoremove: yes
      purge: yes
      autoclean: yes
```

Next, we update by replacing `site.yml` with below and run it againt `dev` servers. Recall that our `dev.yml` has our list of servers stored in the inventory folder.

```bash
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common-del.yml
```

Run command below

```bash
sudo ansible-playbook -i /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/inventory/dev.yml /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/playbooks/site.yaml
```

First we run `git pull` to get all our repository changes should incase others changes has been done prior to the last time we worked on it. Then we run git status and commit changes and push to our GutHub repo.

output

```

Once we have pushed our changes to GitHub, our Jenkins-Ansible runs and saves our files and folders to `/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/9/archive`, we can then use this later to run our Ansible playbook.

Next, we run command below to run our Ansible playbook to delete `wireshark`. Notice that our build number is 9.

```bash
ansible-playbook -i /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/9/archive/inventory/dev.yml /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/9/archive/playbooks/site.yml
```

We can also run the command below to achive the same result

```bash
sudo ansible-playbook -i /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/inventory/dev.yml /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/playbooks/site.yml
```

output

```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-62-121:~/ansible-config-mgt$ ansible-playbook -i /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/9/archive/inventory/dev.yml /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/9/archive/playbooks/site.yml

**Note**
I got this error `value of state must be one of: absent` for database server. Though the task says _state: absent_ which is correct, Not sure where Ansible got _removed_ for Ubuntu. Not able to find a fix yet but will still investigate.

```bash
- name: update LB server
  hosts: lb
  remote_user: ubuntu
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: delete wireshark
    apt:

      autoclean: yes
