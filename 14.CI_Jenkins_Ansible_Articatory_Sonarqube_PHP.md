## Configuring Ansible For Jenkins Deployment

1. Install Blue Ocean pluggin in Jenkins server if not already installed 
2. Create a new Pipeline

![jenkins-pipeline](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-jenkins-ansible-p14/img11.PNG?raw=true)

Next, we create our JenkinsFile . In our Ansible-config-mgt folder w create a folder named `deploy`

```bash
mkdir deploy
```
![jenkins-pipeline](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-jenkins-ansible-p14/img12.PNG?raw=true)

We add code below to the `JenkinsFile`. This currently has one stage called build and we are using a shell script to echo building stage

```bash
pipeline {
    agent any

  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        script {
          sh 'echo "Building Stage"'
        }
      }
    }
    }
}
```

Next, we push changes to GitHub.

Next, we configure our ansible project by clicking on configure , Click Build configuration and under script path we add `deploy/Jenkinsfile`

![jenkins-pipeline](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-jenkins-ansible-p14/img13.PNG?raw=true)

Once, the changes was committed to GitHub, Jenkins automatically scanned the repository 

![jenkins-pipeline](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-jenkins-ansible-p14/img14.PNG?raw=true)

Below is the scan log

The build was successful

![jenkins-pipeline](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-jenkins-ansible-p14/img15.PNG?raw=true)

When we click Blue Ocean we see the pipeline job. 

![jenkins-pipeline](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-jenkins-ansible-p14/img16.PNG?raw=true)

The pipeline we created is a multibranch type. This means if we have more than one branch on GitHub , Jenkins will detect then by scanning the repository  and we will be able to trigger a build for each of the branches. To see this in action, do the following:

**Note**: I created a new branch named `feature/jenkinspipeline-stages` but merged it to the main branch before pushing it to GitHub, so Jenkins only detected the main branch. So, I created another branch named `test-feature` and pushed it to GitHub.

1. Create a new branch named `feature/jenkinspipeline-stages`
2. Add another stage to the build stage

```bash
 pipeline {
    agent any

  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        script {
          sh 'echo "Building Stage"'
        }
      }
    }

    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        script {
          sh 'echo "Testing Stage"'
        }
      }
    }
    }
}
```
3. Commit changes and push changes on the new branch to GitHub

```bash
git checkout -b test-feature
git add .
git commit -m "created test-feature branch and added  test1 stage to Jenkinsfile"
git push --set-upstream origin test-feature
```

output

```bash

 * [new branch]      test-feature -> test-feature
Branch 'test-feature' set up to track remote branch 'test-feature' from 'origin
```
4. We click on Scan repository in Jenkins so that new branch shows up

![jenkins-pipeline](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-jenkins-ansible-p14/img17.PNG?raw=true)

![jenkins-pipeline](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-jenkins-ansible-p14/img18.PNG?raw=true)

![jenkins-pipeline](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-jenkins-ansible-p14/img19.PNG?raw=true)

5. Next we checkout to the main branch and merge the `test-feature branch` and push to GitHub.

output

```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-55-57:~/ansible-config-mgt$ git status

```
6. Next we create a new branch named `feature/jenkinspipeline-morestages` and add more stages to the `Jenkinsfile`

```bash
pipeline {
    agent any

  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        script {
          sh 'echo "Building Stage"'
        }
      }
    }

    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        script {
          sh 'echo "Testing Stage"'
        }
      }
    }
      stage('Package') {
      steps {
        script {
          sh 'echo "Package Stage"'
        }
      }
    }
       stage('Deploy') {
      steps {
        script {
          sh 'echo "Deploy Stage"'
        }
      }
    }
        stage('Clean Up') {
      steps {
        script {
          sh 'echo "Clean Up Stage"'
        }
      }
    }
    }
}

```

Next, we add, commit and push changes to GitHub

Output

```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-55-57:~/ansible-config-mgt$ git add .
ubuntu@ip-172-31-55-57:~/ansible-config-mgt$ git commit -m "created new branch and added 3 more stages"

Jenkins automatically scanned the new branches aand a new build was initiated.

![jenkins-pipeline](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-jenkins-ansible-p14/img21.PNG?raw=true)

Next, we checkout to our main branch and merge `feature/jenkinspipeline-morestages ` and push our changes to GitHub
Our Blue Ocean Pipeline now have all the stages

## Running Ansible Playbook From Jenkins

1. We install Ansible on Jenkins if it was not already installed
2. Install Ansible plugin in Jenkins UI . To do this go to Manage Jenkins on the Dashboard -> Manage Plugins under Available Tab , search for `ansible` and install it without restart.
3. Delete all stages in Jenkins file we had before.
4. Click Manage Jenkins -> Global Configuration tool -> scroll down to ansible and click on it. Under name type ansible, it can be any name -> under path type `/usr/bin/` which is the the default path that ansible was installed on the Jenkins server and save.
5. Click `New Item` to create new job name it `ansible-project`, click pipeline and ok.
<!-- remove -->
6. Click Pipeline tab and below . We want to link our github repo. We make use of the pipeline syntax to do this.

```yml
pipeline{
    agent any
    stages{
        stage('SCM Checkout'){
            steps{
                git 'https://github.com/thinkC/ansible-config-mgt-new'
            }
        }
        stage('Execute Ansible'){
            steps{
                ansiblePlaybook credentialsId: 'privateKEY', disableHostKeyChecking: true, installation: 'ansible', inventory: 'inventory/${inventory_file}', playbook: 'playbooks/site.yml'
            }
        }
        stage('Cleanup Workspace'){
            steps{
                cleanWs()
            }
        }
    }
}
```
