# Deploy secure Auto scaling Web Applications on AWS VPC using Load Balancing and Reverse Proxy Technlogies

![title](./img-aws-pj15/img1-title.png)

## Introduction

In this project we shall build two websites for a company , one will serve as tooling website for DevOps Team and the other a wordpress site for business activities.

We shall build this on Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and have features such as security, scalability, auto scaling and reverse proxy. We shall employ the use of Amazon Elastic Cloud service (EFS) to store and distribute our files and use Amazon RDS - A relational Database sevice to host our database.

Please note that most of the resources used in this project are not covered under the AWS free tier, so ensure you delete all resources after the project so that you will not be charged by AWS.

## How it works
When a user on the internet tries to access our web site `https://tooling.toolingwebapp.ml/login.php` or `https://wordpress.toolingwebapp.ml/wp-admin/index.php`, Route53 reolves the DNS name to the IP address of the ALB (Application Load Balancer). This first ALB is internet facing. The external ALB or internet facing then forwards the traffic to the reverse proxy server (Nginx server). This Nginx server is configured to forward every traffic it receives to the internal ALB. The external ALB, Nginx reverse proxy are placed in the public subnet 1 and 2.

On Private subnet 1 and 2 we have the internal ALB and behind it are the web servers (tooling web application  and the wordpress web application).

## How the internal ALB forwards traffic to the correct webserver

First we set host header on the Nginx reverse-proxy server and configure internal ALB to check for host header on the Nginx reverse proxy server. This we do by setting two rules on the Internal ALB - Default rule forwards wordpress request to wordpress target servers and the second rule, we set a condition on the internal ALB to check the host header on the Nginx server and if it is tooling,  forward it to the tooling website.

Private subnet 3 and 4 have the Amazon RDS and Amazon EFS. We mount the webservers files on the EFS and store database on AWS RDS.


* Route53 - AWS DNS that resolves IP address to server names.
* Internet gateway - Allows communication between vpc and the internet.
* Application Load Balancer (ALB) - Routes/distributes incoming enduser traffic to multiple applications.
* VPC -A logical Isolated section of AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network you define.
* Reverse proxy - Typically sits behind a firewall in a private network and direct client request to the appropriate backend servers.
* Auto scaling - Helps in automatically scaling up or down of different resources due to demands.
* NAT Gateway - Allows our private subnet communicate with the internet.
* Amazo Elastic File System - EFS - Used to store and distribute files to multiples servers. Acts as a central storage.
* Amazon RDS - Managed Relational Database service.


## Setup A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

1. Create a VPC

![VPC](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img9.PNG?raw=true)

![VPC](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img9a0.PNG?raw=true)


Enable DNS hostname to allow instances to get IP 

![VPC](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img9a.PNG?raw=true)

Create Internet Gateway for the VPC to reach the internet and attach it to the newly created `ennovative-vpc` VPC.

![IGW](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img10.PNG?raw=true)

![IGW](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img11.PNG?raw=true)

We create subnets has shown below

![subnets](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img36-subnets.PNG?raw=true)

<!-- ![subnet](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img14.PNG?raw=true)

Create route private route table and associate private subnets with it.
![RT](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img15.PNG?raw=true) -->


Associate the public route table that comes with the VPC we created with the public subnets.

![RT](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img16.PNG?raw=true)

How our route tables looks

![RT](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img16a.PNG?raw=true)

Add internet gateway to the public route table

![Public-tbable-IGW](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/Newfolder/img5-pub-routeTable-internetGW.PNG?raw=true)

<!-- correction -->
We create two route tables, public and private route table

Next, we associate the public subnets to the public route Table and private subnets to the private routable.

Next we edit the public route table and attach it to the internet gateway we created.Now we have our instance to reach the internet.

![RT](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img15.PNG?raw=true)


Next, we create a NAT gateway and associate that to the private route table. First we create elastic IP that we attach to the NAT Gateway.

![Elastic-NAT](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img-elastic-NAT.png?raw=true)

Creating NAT Gateway.We create the NAT Gateway in the public subnet.

![Elastic-NAT](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img-NAT.png?raw=true)

Next, we edit the private route Table and and add the NAT gateway.

![prvt-NAT](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img-prtb-nat.png?raw=true)


Our route tables now looks like this

![Route-Tables](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img-route-tables.png?raw=true)

## Security Groups

Here we create the security groups

ennovative-external-ALB-sg - Allow HTTPS and HTTP traffic from anywhere on the internet

ennovative-bastion-sg - Allow traffic from bastion. Here we allow only traffic from our computer.

ennovative-nginx-reverse-proxy-sg - Allow traffic only from the external ALB (since external ALB forwards traffic to the Nginx)

![nginx-sg](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img-nginx-sg.png?raw=true)

ennovative-internal-ALB-sg - Allows HTTPS and HTTPS traffic only from Nginx reverse proxy security group. We also add SSH traffic form the bastion only.

ennovative-webservers-sg - Allows traffic only from the internal ALB

![webservers-sg](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img-webservers-sg.png?raw=true)

ennovative-datalayer-sg - Allow SSH traffic for bastion only to be able to create database on the database instance.
Allow port 2049 for NFS for web server access.
Allow port 3306 for MySQL for web server access.

![datalayer-sg](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img-datalayer-sg.PNG?raw=true)

All Security Groups

![security-groups](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img-security-groups.png?raw=true)



<!-- Create 3 elastic IPs

![RT](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img17.PNG?raw=true)

Next we create a NAT gateway so that instances in our private network can have access to the internet but external services outside of our VPC will not be able to reach it.
We assign one of the elastic IP to this one. Its on Public Subnet 1 in Availability zone A.

Next, we attach the NAT Gateway to the private routable

![Private-rt-NAT-GW](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/Newfolder/img6-privateRT-NATGW.PNG?raw=true)

![NAT](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img18.PNG?raw=true)

9. Create security group for Nginx servers . _Access to Nginx should only be allowed from both internal ALB and internet facing Application Load balancer (ALB)_.

![SG](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img19.PNG?raw=true)

Create security group for Bastion server. Alllow access from our workstation IP. We will use `curl www.canhazip.com` on the terminal to get access to it.
![SG](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img20.PNG?raw=true)

Create security group for Application Load Balancer from the internet

![SG](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img21.PNG?raw=true)

Create sercurity group for Data layer - We will allow inbound rule for mysql on bastion server, mysql on webservers and open EFS port also on webserver

![SG](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img22.PNG?raw=true)

## Create Hosted Zone

On Route53 we create a hosted zone
* Click on Route 53
* Click create hosted zone
* Enter domain name we got on freenom website
* Click Create hosted zone
* Copy content of the NS record and paste it on name servers on freenom
* On freenom website click Manage Domain next to your domain name and clickl Management Toools and select Nameservers

![route53](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img32-domain2.PNG?raw=true)



## Create ACM Certificate

We create a certificate and attach it to the domain name we got from freenom and now linked to AWS Route 53. We will need this certificate when we are creating our Application Load Balancer (both internet and intranet facing ALB) as our instances will be listening ion port 443 behind the ALB.

![ACM](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/Newfolder/img10-ACM-certificate.PNG?raw=true)

![ACM](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/Newfolder/img10-ACM-certificate1.PNG?raw=true)



* Go to AWS ACM
* Click Get started unter prrovision certificate
* Click request a certificate
* Type the domain name that was registered in freenom `toolingwebapp.ml`. Note you can also add other domain names or use a wildcard using '*.<domainname>' . Here we add two `www.toolingwebapp.ml	www.wpress.toolingwebapp.ml	`
* Click next and selecte DNS validation
* Click next and tag certificate and click review to confirm request
* Click create record in route53. This will automatically create the record in route53.
* Go to Route 53 and create a new CNAME record from the DNS configuration.csv file downloaded.

## Create Amazon EFS

Next we create Amazon elastic File system. This will be used to mount filesystems on both Nginx and Webservers to store data.
Our task here is for the webservers to be able to mount to the EFS. Inother to do this we will need to create the EFS in the same subnet that we have the webservers.

![EFS](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img37-efs1.PNG?raw=true)

Here we choose private subnet1 and private subnet2 and choose datalayer security group. Note these subnets are where we have the webservers.

![EFS](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img37-efs2.PNG?raw=true)

EFS created

![EFS](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img37-efs3.PNG?raw=true)

## Create access point

Click on teh EFS we just created and click on access point,  Access point is are the webservers (wordpress site and tooling website).

Name - `wordpress`
Root Directory - `/wordpress`
POSIX user ID, GroupID, owner UserID - `0` (Zero for root)
Permmission - `0755` - So that webservers can be able to write

![EFS](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img37-efs4.PNG?raw=true)

We create same for tooling same as above

![EFS](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img37-efs5.PNG?raw=true)

## Setup RDS

As a pre-requsite for RDS we will need to create KMS key from Key Management Service. This will be used to encrypt database instance.
* Go to KMS console and click create a key.
* Choose symmetric and click Advance option should be KMS and click next
* Give it a name , here I name it `enno-rds`
* Give it a Tag name
* Check your name to set yourself as key administrator
* Check your name to set yourself for key usage permission
* Click finish after reviewing.

![KMS](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img37-kms.PNG?raw=true)

## Create RDS

First, we create a subnet group.
* Click Amazon RDS
* Click subnet groups and click create DB subnet Group
* Give it a name
* Choose your VPC
* Add both Availability zones
* Select subnets we have the RDS
* Click create

Next we create a RDS Database

* Click create database
* Select MySQL
* Select Free tier. Note we will not be able to encrypt our RDS instance.
* Use `admin` as username 
* Set a password . password12345
* Choose your VPC, subnmet will be automatically added.
* Choose No for public access. RDS will not be accessible from the internet
* Choose datalayer-sg as VPC security group, our RDS resides in the layerlayer security group.
* Choose any of the availablility zone
* Under database option for name give it `testDB`

Database created

![RDS](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img39-rds.PNG?raw=true)

cd efs-utils

sudo yum install -y make

sudo yum install -y rpm-build

sudo make rpm 

sudo yum install -y  ./build/amazon-efs-utils*rpm
```

### Setup self-signed certificate for Nginx instance

Next we setup self-signed certificate for nginx instance

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/ssl/private
sudo chmod 700 /etc/ssl/private

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/ennovative.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/ennovative.crt

sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem 2048

vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
``` -->

<!--end for compute resource  -->

<!-- ## Create Compute Resources.

We will create and configure the following compute resources.
* EC2 Instances
* Launch Templates
* Target Groups
* Autoscaling Groups
* TLS Certificates
* Application Load Balancers (ALB)


## Compute Resource for Nginx
We create an Amazon EC2 instance type in Availability zone A in the Public subnet

![SG](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img24.PNG?raw=true)

Note: Our ALB will be sending traffic on port 443. For the connection to be secure we need to create a self signed certificate on the target groups for the ALB.

Next we check if the following are installed if not we install them:
* python
* ntp
* net-tools
* vim
* wget
* telnet
* epel-release
* htop

```bash
yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

yum install -y dnf-utils http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-8.rpm

yum install wget vim python3 telnet htop git mysql net-tools chrony -y

systemctl start chronyd

systemctl enable chronyd
```
Next we configure selinux policies for webservers and nginx servers
```bash
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect=1
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db=1
setsebool -P httpd_execmem=1
setsebool -P httpd_use_nfs 1

Next we will install amazon EFS utils for mounting the target on the Elastic file System.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws/efs-utils

cd efs-utils

sudo yum install -y make

sudo yum install -y rpm-build

sudo make rpm 

sudo yum install -y  ./build/amazon-efs-utils*rpm

## Webserver

We install below on the webserver for ami setup

```bash
yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

yum install -y dnf-utils http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-8.rpm

yum install wget vim python3 telnet htop git mysql net-tools chrony -y

systemctl start chronyd

systemctl enable chronyd
```

Configure selinux policies for webserver

```bash
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect=1
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db=1
setsebool -P httpd_execmem=1
setsebool -P httpd_use_nfs 1
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws/efs-utils
cd efs-utils
yum install -y make
yum install -y rpm-build
make rpm 
yum install -y  ./build/amazon-efs-utils*rpm
``` -->

## Setup self-signed certificate for Apache Webserver instance

```bash
yum install -y mod_ssl

openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout /etc/pki/tls/private/ACS.key -x509 -days 365 -out /etc/pki/tls/certs/ACS.crt

vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
```

Openssl will make the Apache webserver have a self-signed certificate

output

```bash
[ec2-user@ip-10-0-1-92 ~]$ sudo openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout /etc/pki/tls/private/enno.key -x509 -days 365 -out /etc/pki/tls/certs/enno.crt

```

Edit the ssl.conf file and change it to `SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/ennovative.crt` from local.crt

We do same by changing to _enno.key_ in `SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/ennovative.key` change from local.key

```bash
sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
```

## Create AMI

* Click on action -> image and template -> create image

![ami](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img40-webserver-ami.PNG?raw=true)

We create image for Bastion and nginx

ami's created

Creating Target Groups

First we create Target group for Nginx
![TG](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img42-TG-nginx.PNG?raw=true)

Auto Scaling Group will later launch instances into the Target Group

![TG](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img42-TG-nginx1.PNG?raw=true)

Next, we create Target Group for wordpress and tooling

![TG](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img42-TargetGroups.png?raw=true)

## Create Application Load Balancer

First we create external internet facing ALB.

* Click create Load Balancer 
* Choose internet facing
* Under Listner , choose HTTPS , since the Target groups are on HTTPS
* Select the VPC we created and the Avaialbility zones which is two in our setup
* Choose the two public subnets as the external ALB needs to be in the public subnet
* Tag if you want and click next
* For certificate type choose certificate from ACM. You will notice it automatically populated the certificate we created earlier.
* Click next to configure security groups and select the external ALB security group
* Click next to configure routing
* Select existing Target Group
* For name choose enno-TG-nginx since the external ALB forwards traffic to the nginx server and ensure the path is `/healthstatus` under path.
* Click next and next to review and create

Next create Internal ALB

Give it a name. Setup is the same as above only diffrence is that we select private subnet 1 and private subnet 2 and choose internal ALB security group. 
Under configuring routing, since there are wordpress and tooling in the private subnet behind the internal Load Balancer , we will make one as default. We select wordpress as the default and configure a rule to forward to the tooling target. 

![ALB](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img43-ALB-internal.PNG?raw=true)

## Configuring Internal ALB
* Click on Listener Tab
* Click on view and edit rules
By default, traffic to the Internal ALB is forwarded to the wordpress Target Group.

![ALB](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img43-ALB-internal1.PNG?raw=true)

Next, we will configure a rule to direct tooling traffic to the Tooling Target Group.
Click the plus button and click interset rule and click add condition and choose Host header. 

The condition says if the traffic is `www.toolingwebapp.ml` then forward to Tooling Target Group

## Creating Launch Templates

Next we create Launch Templates for Bastion, Nginx and webservers.
* Give it an name
* Choose AMI for bastion
* Choose t2 micro 1GB instance type
* Select key pair
* Choose VPC
* Under Network interface, for subnet, since bastion will be in the public subnet choose eith public subnet 1 or public subnet 2, choose bastion security group, choose enable to auto assign IP
* Under advance add code below for user data

#### User daata for Bation
```bash
#!/bin/bash 
yum install -y mysql 
yum install -y git tmux 
yum install -y ansible
```
* Click create launch template

## Create Nginx Launch Template

Same as above, but choose ami for nginx and under network choose any of the public subnet , nginx-security group and enable auto-assign Public IP.

Add below user data in advance section for nginx

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum install -y nginx
systemctl start nginx
systemctl enable nginx
git clone https://github.com/thinkC/ennovative-project-config.git
mv ennovative-project-config/reverse.conf /etc/nginx/
mv /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf-distro
cd /etc/nginx/
touch nginx.conf
sed -n 'w nginx.conf' reverse.conf
systemctl restart nginx
rm -rf reverse.conf
rm -rf /ennovative-project-config

```

## Create Wordpress Launch Template

Same as above, but choose ami for webserver and under network choose private subnet 1 or 2 , webserver-security group and disable auto-assign Public IP.

Go to Elastic File System -> Access point -> Wordpress -> attach ad copy `sudo mount -t efs -o tls,accesspoint=fsap-05acf45736def653d fs-8c1a4138:/ efs` .change efs to /var/www/ , since that is our mount point.
Add below to user data under advance

```bash
#!/bin/bash
mkdir /var/www/
sudo mount -t efs -o tls,accesspoint=fsap-05acf45736def653d fs-8c1a4138:/ /var/www/
yum install -y httpd 
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
yum module reset php -y
yum module enable php:remi-7.4 -y
yum install -y php php-common php-mbstring php-opcache php-intl php-xml php-gd php-curl php-mysqlnd php-fpm php-json
systemctl start php-fpm
systemctl enable php-fpm
wget http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar xzvf latest.tar.gz
rm -rf latest.tar.gz
cp wordpress/wp-config-sample.php wordpress/wp-config.php
mkdir /var/www/html/
cp -R /wordpress/* /var/www/html/
cd /var/www/html/
touch healthstatus
sed -i "s/localhost/enno-database.ccsif1mqniv8.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com/g" wp-config.php 
sed -i "s/username_here/admin/g" wp-config.php 
sed -i "s/password_here/password12345/g" wp-config.php 
sed -i "s/database_name_here/wordpressdb/g" wp-config.php 
chcon -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t /var/www/html/ -R
systemctl restart httpd
```

## Create Tooling Launch Template

Same as above, but choose ami for webserver and under network choose private subnet 1 or 2 , webserver-security group and disable auto-assign Public IP.

Add code below to user data in Advance section

```bash
#!/bin/bash
mkdir /var/www/
sudo mount -t efs -o tls,accesspoint=fsap-0ca7ae5a3056b126e fs-8c1a4138:/ /var/www/
yum install -y httpd 
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
yum module reset php -y
yum module enable php:remi-7.4 -y
yum install -y php php-common php-mbstring php-opcache php-intl php-xml php-gd php-curl php-mysqlnd php-fpm php-json
systemctl start php-fpm
systemctl enable php-fpm
git clone https://github.com/Livingstone95/tooling-1.git
mkdir /var/www/html
cp -R /tooling-1/html/*  /var/www/html/
cd /tooling-1
mysql -h acs-database.cdqpbjkethv0.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u ACSadmin -p toolingdb < tooling-db.sql
cd /var/www/html/
touch healthstatus
sed -i "s/$db = mysqli_connect('mysql.tooling.svc.cluster.local', 'admin', 'admin', 'tooling');/$db = mysqli_connect('enno-database.ccsif1mqniv8.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com ', 'admin', 'password12345', 'toolingdb');/g" functions.php
chcon -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t /var/www/html/ -R
systemctl restart httpd
```

## Create Auto Scaling Group

### Bastion
First we create Auto Scaling Group for Bastion
* Click create auto scaling group
* Choose Bastion Launch Template we created before
* Click next and chose your VPC
* Choose piblic subnet 1 and 2 and click next
* Do not choose Load Balancer , since bastion is not behind a load balancer
* Check ELB and click next
* Leave group size as default
* Select tracking policy and set Target value for CPU to be 90 and click next
* Create a notification by creating a topic and add email for notification.
* Add a tag and click create.

### Nginx

* Click create auto scaling group
* Choose Nginx Launch Template we created before
* Click next and chose your VPC
* Choose public subnet 1 and public subnet 2 and click next
* Choose existing Load Balancer and choose target group attached to the load balancer for nginx.
* Check ELB and click next
* Leave group size as default
* Select tracking policy and set Target value for CPU to be 90 and click next
* Choose same notification you created for bastion.
* Add a tag and click create.

Next, we cinfigure database by connecting to the Bastion server created by the auto scaling group. Here, I am using ssh-agent to connect to the bastion server then connect to the RDS endpoint. We use admin as username and password12345 and create wordpressdb and toolingdb databases.

```bash
mysql -h enno-database.ccsif1mqniv8.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p
```
output

```sql
[ec2-user@ip-10-0-1-66 ~]$ mysql -h enno-database.ccsif1mqniv8.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p
Enter password:
