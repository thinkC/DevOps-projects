## Setup A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

1. Create a VPC

![VPC](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img9.PNG?raw=true)

![VPC](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img9a0.PNG?raw=true)


Enable DNS hostname to allow instances to get IP 

![VPC](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img9a.PNG?raw=true)

Create Internet Gateway for the VPC to reach the internet and attach it to the newly created `ennovative-vpc` VPC.

![IGW](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img11.PNG?raw=true)

We create subnets has shown below

![subnets](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img36-subnets.PNG?raw=true)

The `ennovative-vpc`has a route table so we use it.

![RT](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img15.PNG?raw=true)

Attach the route table to internet gateway we created.Now we have our instance to reach the internet.

![subnet](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img14.PNG?raw=true)

![subnet](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img14c.PNG?raw=true)

Create route private route table and associate private subnets with it.
![RT](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img15.PNG?raw=true)


Associate the public route table that comes with the VPC we creeated with the public subnets.

![RT](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img16.PNG?raw=true)

How our route tables looks

![RT](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img16a.PNG?raw=true)

Add internet gateway to the public route table

![Public-tbable-IGW](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/Newfolder/img5-pub-routeTable-internetGW.PNG?raw=true)

Create 3 elastic IPs

![RT](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img17.PNG?raw=true)

Next we create a NAT gateway so that instances in our private network can have access to the internet but external services outside of our VPC will not be able to reach it.
We assign one of the elastic IP to this one. Its on Public Subnet 1 in Availability zone A.

Next, we attach the NAT Gateway to the private routable

![NAT](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img18.PNG?raw=true)

9. Create security group for Nginx servers . _Access to Nginx should only be allowed from both internal ALB and internet facing Application Load balancer (ALB)_.

![SG](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img19.PNG?raw=true)

Create security group for Bastion server. Alllow access from our workstation IP. We will use `curl www.canhazip.com` on the terminal to get access to it.
![SG](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img20.PNG?raw=true)

Create security group for Application Load Balancer from the internet

![SG](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img21.PNG?raw=true)

Create sercurity group for Data layer - We will allow inbound rule for mysql on bastion server, mysql on webservers and open EFS port also on webserver

![SG](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img22.PNG?raw=true)

![SG](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img23.PNG?raw=true)

## Create Hosted Zone

On Route53 we create a hosted zone
* Click on Route 53
* Click create hosted zone
* Enter domain name we got on freenom website
* Click Create hosted zone
* Copy content of the NS record and paste it on name servers on freenom
* On freenom website click Manage Domain next to your domain name and clickl Management Toools and select Nameservers

![route53](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img32-domain2.PNG?raw=true)



## Create ACM Certificate

We create a certificate and attach it to the domain name we got from freenom and now linked to AWS Route 53. We will need this certificate when we are creating our Application Load Balancer (both internet and intranet facing ALB) as our instances will be listening ion port 443 behind the ALB.

![ACM](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/Newfolder/img10-ACM-certificate.PNG?raw=true)

* Go to AWS ACM
* Click Get started unter prrovision certificate
* Click request a certificate
* Type the domain name that was registered in freenom `toolingwebapp.ml`. Note you can also add other domain names or use a wildcard using '*.<domainname>' . Here we add two `www.toolingwebapp.ml	www.wpress.toolingwebapp.ml	`
* Click next and selecte DNS validation
* Click next and tag certificate and clieck review to confirm request
* Click continue and Click export DNS configuration file
* Go to Route 53 and create a new CNAME record from the DNS configuration.csv file downloaded.

## Create Amazon EFS

Next we create Amazon elastic File system. This will be used to mount filesystems on both Nginx and Webservers to store data.
Our task here is for the webservers to be able to mount to the EFS. Inother to do this we will need to create the EFS in the same subnet that we have the webservers.

![EFS](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img37-efs1.PNG?raw=true)

Here we choose private subnet1 and private subnet2 and choose datalayer security group. Note these subnets are where we have the webservers.

![EFS](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img37-efs2.PNG?raw=true)

EFS created

![EFS](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img37-efs3.PNG?raw=true)

## Create access point

Click on teh EFS we just created and click on access point,  Access point is are the webservers (wordpress site and tooling website).

Name - `wordpress`
Root Directory - `/wordpress`
POSIX user ID, GroupID, owner UserID - `0` (Zero for root)
Permmission - `0755` - So that webservers can be able to write

![EFS](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img37-efs4.PNG?raw=true)

We create same for tooling same as above

![EFS](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img37-efs5.PNG?raw=true)

## Setup RDS

As a pre-requsite for RDS we will need to create KMS key from Key Management Service. This will be used to encrypt database instance.
* Go to KMS console and click create a key.
* Advance option shoudl be KMS and click next
* Give it a name , here I name it `enno-rds`
* Give it a Tag name
* Check your name to set yourself as key administrator
* Check your name to set yourself for key usage permission
* Click finish after reviewing.

![KMS](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img37-kms.PNG?raw=true)

## Create RDS

First, we create a subnet group.
* Click Amazon RDS
* Click subnet groups and click create DB subnet Group
* Give it a name
* Choose your VPC
* Add both Availability zones
* Select subnets we have the RDS
* Click create

Next we create a RDS Database

* Click create database
* Select MySQL
* Select Free tier. Note we will not be able to encrypt our RDS instance.
* Use `admin` as username 
* Set a password . password12345
* Choose your VPC, subnmet will be automatically added.
* Choose No for public access. RDS will not be accessible from the internet
* Choose datalayer-sg as VPC security group, our RDS resides in the layerlayer security group.
* Choose any of the availablility zone
* Under database option for name give it `testDB`

Database created

![RDS](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img39-rds.PNG?raw=true)



## Create Compute Resources.

We will create and configure the following compute resources.
* EC2 Instances
* Launch Templates
* Target Groups
* Autoscaling Groups
* TLS Certificates
* Application Load Balancers (ALB)


## Compute Resource for Nginx
We create an Amazon EC2 instance type in Availability zone A in the Public subnet

![SG](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects1/blob/main/img-aws-pj15/img24.PNG?raw=true)

Note: Our ALB will be sending traffic on port 443. For the connection to be secure we need to create a self signed certificate on the target groups for the ALB.

Next we check if the following are installed if not we install them:
* python
* ntp
* net-tools
* vim
* wget
* telnet
* epel-release
* htop

```bash
yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

yum install -y dnf-utils http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-8.rpm

yum install wget vim python3 telnet htop git mysql net-tools chrony -y

systemctl start chronyd

systemctl enable chronyd
```
Next we configure selinux policies for webservers and nginx servers
```bash
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect=1
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db=1
setsebool -P httpd_execmem=1
setsebool -P httpd_use_nfs 1
```

Next we will install amazon EFS utils for mounting the target on the Elastic file System.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws/efs-utils

cd efs-utils

sudo yum install -y make

sudo yum install -y rpm-build

sudo make rpm 

sudo yum install -y  ./build/amazon-efs-utils*rpm
```

Next we setup self-signed certificate for nginx instance

output

Common Nmae or Hostname is the Private ipv4 DNS address.

```bash
[ec2-user@ip-10-0-1-173 ~]$ sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/enno.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/enno.crt
Generating a RSA private key
................................................+++++
............................................................+++++
writing new private key to '/etc/ssl/private/enno.key'
-----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:NG
State or Province Name (full name) []:Lagos
Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:Lagos
Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:ennovative
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:DevOps
Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:ip-10-0-1-173.ec2.internal
Email Address []:singularbits@gmail.com
[ec2-user@ip-10-0-1-173 ~]$
```

We use this certificate by specifying the path `/etc/ssl/private/enno.key` and `/etc/ssl/certs/enno.crt` in our Nginx configuration.

checking 

output

```bash
[ec2-user@ip-10-0-1-173 ~]$ sudo ls -l /etc/ssl/certs/
total 8
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root   49 Jun 22  2020 ca-bundle.crt -> /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root   55 Jun 22  2020 ca-bundle.trust.crt -> /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/openssl/ca-bundle.trust.crt

-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 1493 Aug 17 21:54 enno.crt
[ec2-user@ip-10-0-1-173 ~]$
```

output

```bash
[ec2-user@ip-10-0-1-173 ~]$ sudo ls -l /etc/ssl/private/
total 4
-rw-------. 1 root root 1708 Aug 17 21:52 enno.key
[ec2-user@ip-10-0-1-173 ~]$
```

## Webserver

We install below on the webserver for ami setup

```bash
yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

yum install -y dnf-utils http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-8.rpm

yum install wget vim python3 telnet htop git mysql net-tools chrony -y

systemctl start chronyd

systemctl enable chronyd
```

Configure selinux policies for webserver

```bash
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect=1
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db=1
setsebool -P httpd_execmem=1
setsebool -P httpd_use_nfs 1
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws/efs-utils
cd efs-utils
yum install -y make
yum install -y rpm-build
make rpm 
yum install -y  ./build/amazon-efs-utils*rpm
```

## Setup self-signed certificate for Apache Webserver instance

```bash
yum install -y mod_ssl

openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout /etc/pki/tls/private/ACS.key -x509 -days 365 -out /etc/pki/tls/certs/ACS.crt

vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
```

Openssl will make the Apache webserver have a self-signed certificate

output

```bash
[ec2-user@ip-10-0-1-92 ~]$ sudo openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout /etc/pki/tls/private/enno.key -x509 -days 365 -out /etc/pki/tls/certs/enno.crt
Generating a RSA private key

```

Edit the ssl.conf file and change it to `SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/enno.crt` from local.crt

We do same by changing to _enno.key_ in `SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/enno.key` change from local.key

```bash
sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
```
