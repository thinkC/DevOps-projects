# Web stack implementation using (LEMP Stack)

## Introduction

LEMP stack is combination of open source sotware used in serving web applications. It comprises of Linux operating system, Nginx (pronounced engine-x), MySQL and PHP, hence the acroymn LEMP.

First we setup a Linux server, here I am using Ubuntu VM on AWS, created a security group and opened both port 22 for ssh and port 80 for HTTP access.

Next, I connect to the Linux server using ssh as below.

```bash
ssh -i C:\Users\Babatunde\Desktop\Downloads\pem\mysingular-EC2.pem ubuntu@52.87.232.212
```

## Step 1

We will use the poupular high-performance web server called Nginx to display our web pages. We will need to install _nginx_ using the _apt_ package manager. Type `Y` when propted to install.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

After installation we then verify if nginx was installed sucessfully.

```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

We should get output as below. This shows we have first installed a web server in the cloud!.

![nginx](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-lemp-stack/img2.PNG?raw=true)

To have access to our web server, we need to open port 80 for HTTP, on our security group. We already did this when we are setting up our EC2 ubumtu server.

![http-port80](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-lemp-stack/img3.PNG?raw=true)

## Using curl command to access our web server on port 80

```bash
curl http://localhost:80
```

Our output should be

```html
ubuntu@ip-172-31-59-22:~$ curl http://localhost:80
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
<p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
working. Further configuration is required.</p>

<p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
```
We now test our nginx web server on the browser. Type below on the browser. Replave teh public IP with your own.

```bash 
http://52.87.232.212/
```
output

![http-port80](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-lemp-stack/img4.PNG?raw=true)

## Step 2 - Installing mySQL

We use _apt_ to acquire and install the mySQL and type `Y` when prompted.

Run command below
```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server
```

Next, it is recommended we install a security script that comes with MySQL, this will remove some insecure default settings and lock down access to the database.

Let run command below to start:

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

We will be asked to `VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN`

output

```bash
Securing the MySQL server deployment.

Connecting to MySQL using a blank password.

VALIDATE PASSWORD COMPONENT can be used to test passwords
and improve security. It checks the strength of password
and allows the users to set only those passwords which are
secure enough. Would you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD component?

Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No: Y

There are three levels of password validation policy:

LOW    Length >= 8
MEDIUM Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, and special characters
STRONG Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, special characters and dictionary                  file

Please enter 0 = LOW, 1 = MEDIUM and 2 = STRONG: 0
Please set the password for root here.

New password:

Re-enter new password:

Estimated strength of the password: 100
Do you wish to continue with the password provided?(Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y
By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user,
allowing anyone to log into MySQL without having to have
a user account created for them. This is intended only for
testing, and to make the installation go a bit smoother.
You should remove them before moving into a production
environment.

Remove anonymous users? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y
Success.


Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from
'localhost'. This ensures that someone cannot guess at
the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y
Success.

By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that
anyone can access. This is also intended only for testing,
and should be removed before moving into a production
environment.


Remove test database and access to it? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y
 - Dropping test database...
Success.

 - Removing privileges on test database...
Success.

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes
made so far will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y
Success.

All done!
```

Next, we test if we are able to login to the mySql

```bash
sudo mysql
```

output

```bash
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 10
Server version: 8.0.25-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 (Ubuntu)

owners.

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql>
```

As seen from the above output, we are able to login to the MySql as root, which is the database root user. This should not be confused with the ubuntu root user.

Type _exit_ command to exit mysql


```
output

```bash
mysql> exit
Bye
```

## Step 3 - Installing PHP

So far, we have installed _nginx_ to as our content, _mysql_ to store and manage our data, next is to install _php_ to generate dynamic content for our web server. 
Nginx requires an external program to handle PHP proceessing and acts as a bridge between PHP interprter itself and web server. This approach is different with Apache which embedes PHP interpreter in each request.

The nginx method allows for better performance but will require additional configuration.

We will need to install _php-fpm_ (PHP fastCGI process manager). This tells Nginx to pass PHP request to this software for processing.
We will also need to install `php-mysql` . This is a PHP module that PHP to communicate with MYSql database. Type `Y` when prompted.

Run command below

```bash
sudo apt install php-fpm php-mysql
```

Now we now have the PHP components installed. Next, we will configire nginx to use them.

## Step 4 - Configuring Nginx to use PHP processor

Here we will create server block to host various domain in a single server just like its used in Apache virtual host. In this example we will use `projectLEMP` as an example domain name.

By default on Ubuntu 20.04, Nginx has a server block that servers web pages on _/var/www/html_. We will create our own so that pages that do not match our site will default to _/var/www/html_ .

We will create a new directory

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/www/projectLEMP
```

output - check directory.

```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-59-22:~$ ls /var/www
html  projectLEMP
```
Next, we change ownership with the $USER envornment variable to reference current logged in user.

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/projectLEMP
```
check ownership

```bash
ls -l /var/www
```

output

```bash
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 root   root   4096 Jun 20 12:14 html
drwxr-xr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Jun 20 14:34 projectLEMP
```
Next, we create a new configuration file by running command below, using nano editor.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP
```

We then add code below

```bash
#/etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name projectLEMP www.projectLEMP;
    root /var/www/projectLEMP;

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
     }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

}
```



Next, we activate the configuration, this will tell Nginx to use this configuration next time it is loaded.

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```
Testing the configuration

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```
output
```bash
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```
Next, we disable default Nginx host currently configured to listen on port 80
```bash
sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```
Reload Nginx to apply changes

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

At this point, the new website is now active but web root `/var/www/projectLEMP` is still empty

We create an index.html file

```bash
sudo touch /var/www/projectLEMP/index.html
```

Next, we edit the indext.html

```bash
sudo nano /var/www/projectLEMP/index.html
```
and add the code below

```html
!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
    <h1>Hello LEMP from hostname</h1>


</body>
</html>
```
Next, we test this on the browser using our public IP address.

```bash
http://52.87.232.212/index.html
```

output

![http-port80](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-lemp-stack/img5.PNG?raw=true)

`You can leave this file in place as a temporary landing page for your application until you set up an index.php file to replace it. Once you do that, remember to remove or rename the index.html file from your document root, as it would take precedence over an index.php file by default.

Your LEMP stack is now fully configured. In the next step, weâ€™ll create a PHP script to test that Nginx is in fact able to handle .php files within your newly configured website.`

## Step 5 - Testing PHP with Nginx

Our LEMP stack is now up and runningwe can do an additional test to validate that Nginx can correctly hand `.php` files of to the _PHP Processor_. To achieve this we create a _info.php_ file.

```bash
sudo nano /var/www/projectLEMP/info.php
```
Add the code below, this is a PHP code that will return info about our server.
```bash
<?php
phpinfo();
```

![php-server-info](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-lemp-stack/img6.PNG?raw=true)

Next, we delete the file we just created as it contains sensitive info about our PHP environment.

```bash
sudo rm /var/www/projectLEMP/info.php
```

## Step 6 - Using PHP to retrieve data from MySQL

```bash
sudo mysql
```

```bash
CREATE DATABASE lempdatabase;
```
output 

```bash
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
```

```bash
CREATE USER 'test01'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password01';
```

output
```bash
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)
```

```bash
GRANT ALL ON lempdatabase.* TO 'test01'@'%';
```

output

```bash
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

```bash
exit
```

```bash
mysql -u test01 -p
```
output
```bash
Enter password:

```bash
CREATE TABLE lempdatabase.todo_list (
mysql>     item_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
mysql>     content VARCHAR(255),
mysql>     PRIMARY KEY(item_id)
mysql> );
```

output

```bash
mysql> CREATE TABLE lempdatabase.todo_list (
    -> item_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    -> content VARCHAR(255),
    -> PRIMARY KEY(item_id)
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.08 sec)
```

```bash
INSERT INTO lempdatabase.todo_list (content) VALUES ("Learn LEMP Stack");
```

```bash
SELECT * FROM lempdatabase.todo_list;
```

output

```bash
mysql> SELECT * FROM lempdatabase.todo_list;
+---------+------------------+
| item_id | content          |
+---------+------------------+
|       1 | Learn LEMP Stack |
|       2 | Study my Bible   |
|       3 | Learn Algorithm  |
|       4 | Watch movies     |
+---------+------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

After confirming that you have valid data in your test table, you can exit the MySQL console:

```bash
exit
```

```bash
nano /var/www/projectLEMP/todo_list.php
```

```bash
<?php
$user = "test01";
$password = "password01";
$database = "lempdatabase";
$table = "todo_list";

try {
  $db = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=$database", $user, $password);
  echo "<h2>TODO</h2><ol>";
  foreach($db->query("SELECT content FROM $table") as $row) {
    echo "<li>" . $row['content'] . "</li>";
  }
  echo "</ol>";
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    print "Error!: " . $e->getMessage() . "<br/>";
    die();
}
```


```bash
http://52.87.232.212/todo_list.php
```

output

![todolist](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-lemp-stack/img7.PNG?raw=true)

Congratulations, we have successfully built a LEMP stack app using Nginx web server and MySQL database!/
