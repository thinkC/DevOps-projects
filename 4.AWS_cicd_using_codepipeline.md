# How to Deploy React App to AWS S3 using AWS CI/CD Codepipeline

## Step 1

We create a react app called _birthday_ . This is a `Birthday Reminder App`.

```bash
npx create-react-app birthday
```

After successful installtion we should see below

## Step 2

1. Create a git repository . We can learn how to create a git repository [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-beginners-guide-to-git-how-to-create-your-first-github-project-c3ff53f56861/)
2. We then push all our code to GitHub .
We can learn how to push our code to GitHub  [![Push Code To GitHub](https://img.youtube.com/vi/wrb7Gge9yoE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrb7Gge9yoE "Push Code To GitHub").

## Step 3
### Create s3 Bucket on AWS
1. We login to our AWS Management console and search for s3. and create an s3 bucket. Here I name it _codepipeline-birthday-app_

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img11.png)

We uncheck _block all public access_ and enable _versioning_ and click create bucket
![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img11ca.png)

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img11d.png)

2. Next we click on the new bucket link to edit permission

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img11a.png)

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img11b.png)

Click on edit policy

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
We change the bucket name to name of our bucket , here is is _codepipeline-birthday-app_ and save changes.

## Step 4
### Create Codepipeline on AWS

1. Search for codepipeline on the aws mamnagement console and click create pipleline

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img2.png)

Give it a name , here I give it _birthday-app-codepipeline_ and click next

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img3.png)

2. Choose GitHub version 2 has source provider

Click on connect to GitHub and give your connection any name to create connection. For Gu=ithub Apps, click install a new app. 
If this is the first time you are connecting to GitHub, it will prompt for password

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img4.png)

After successfully connecting to GitHub choose your repository as below and click on next.

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img5.png)

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img5a.png)

3. Next, we add a build stage and choose _aws codebuild_

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img6.png)

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img7.png)

4. Next we click on create project and give it a name . I give it _birthday-app-codepipeline_

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img8.png)

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img8.png)

5. In envoronment, we choose _amazon linux 2_, _standard_ as runtime, image as _standard 3.0_ and _linux_ as envornment type. The _Buildspec_ is the file that will contain our commands to automate the build process. We will create that later.

Under Logs, check cloudwatch log and give it a name and click continue to codepipeline

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img8a.png)

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img8b.png)

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img8c.png)

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img8d.png)

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img8e.png)

We should see like below. It successfully created `birthday-app-codepipeline` in codebuild and we click on next
![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img9.png)

6.We add a deploy stage, this is where our app files will be stored. We choose _s3_.

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img10.png)

We choose our s3 bucket that we created before and check _extract file before deploy_. This will extract our app file to the root of our s3 bucket. This is required for static website hosting. 
We then click on next to review and create pipeline.
![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img10a.png)

The build process will try to start , but this will fail since we have not created the build file, we will do that next.
![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img10b.png)


## Step 5
### Create build file yaml file
1. Open the code editor where we have the react app and create a _buildspec.yml_ at the root of the folder outside the _src_ folder

```bash
touch buildspec.yml
```
2. Add code below to the _buildspec.yml_

```yaml
version: 0.2

phases:
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo "Installing dependencies..."
      - npm install
  build:
    commands:
      - echo "Building React App..."
      - npm run build

artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
  discard-paths: no
  base-directory: build
```

3. We push our changes to GitHub

4. As soon as our code is pushed to github, codepipeline is triggered and 

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img-codebuild17.png)

5. Checking our s3 bucket we now see that the build file has been extracted.

![s3 bucket](./aws-codepipeline-s3/img-codebuild18.png)

6. We click properties tab in s3 bucket and go to static website hsoting and click on the link to see our app deployed!.
