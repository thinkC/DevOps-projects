# Implementing MEAN stack on AWS

In this project we will build a book register web form using MEAN stack.

Step 1: Install NodeJs

_Node.js is an open source JavaScript runtime, used for building fast and scablable network applications. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript emgine. We will be using it iin this project to setup express routes and AngularJS controllers.

First we update and upgrade ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```


Step 2: Install MongoDB

MongoDB is a noSQL document database that stores its contents in a key value form like json objects. It is flexible as in you can change the data structure from time to time. In this example, our book register will have different fields e.g. book name, isbn number, authir and number of pages.

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 0C49F3730359A14518585931BC711F9BA15703C6
```

```bash
echo "deb [ arch=amd64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu trusty/mongodb-org/3.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.4.list
```
Next, we install MongoDB

```bash
sudo apt install mongodb -y
```

Next, we start the server

```bash
sudo service mongodb start
```

we verify if service is up and running.

```bash
sudo systemctl status mongodb
```

output

```bash

```

Next, we install Node package manager

```bash
install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
```

```bash
sudo apt install npm -y
```

Next we install _body-parser_ package . Body-parser works with express js to allow express to ready the body which is then parse into a json object that can be understood by us and used. 

```bash
sudo npm install body-parser
```

output
```bash
npm WARN saveError ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/ubuntu/package.json'

```
Doing ls

```bash
ls
```

output

```bash
node_modules  package-lock.json
```

Next, we create a folder named _Books_ and cd into it.

```bash
mkdir Books && cd Books
```
