# Client-Server Architecture with MySQL

Client-Server architecture is a system of computing where two or more computers are connected over a network to send and receive information. The sending party is refered to as the client and the receiving party as the server which host all resourceas and responds with the desired information.

In this tutorial, we shall demostrate basic client-server using MySQL RDBMS.

Step 1 - Create and configure two Linux -Ubuntu VM on AWS. Server 1 should be named `mysql server` and Server 2 named `mysql client`.

Step 2 - On _mysql server_ install _MySQL Server Software_.

To do this we first run update on the server 1 and install the _mysql-server_ .

```bash
sudo apt update
```

```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server
```

Verify if mysql was successfully installed

```bash
sudo systemctl status mysql
```

output

```bash
● mysql.service - MySQL Community Server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mysql.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Sun 2021-06-27 22:46:51 UTC; 18s ago
   Main PID: 2320 (mysqld)
     Status: "Server is operational"
      Tasks: 38 (limit: 1160)
     Memory: 328.0M
     CGroup: /system.slice/mysql.service
             └─2320 /usr/sbin/mysqld

Jun 27 22:46:50 ip-172-31-62-42 systemd[1]: Starting MySQL Community Server...
Jun 27 22:46:51 ip-172-31-62-42 systemd[1]: Started MySQL Community Server.
```

Next, install Mysql-client on server2 - _mysql client_

We then allow inbound port 3306 on the _mysql server_ for IP addrress of the _mysql client_ server

We can check the _mysql client_ IP as below

```bash
ip addr show
```

output
```bash
...
172.31.9.55/20
```

Step 3 - Secure MySQL server

Next, on our _mysql server_, we run the security script to create a login and a database for our mysql, this is to make it secure

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
Note that, in the Validate Password ,  I chose not to as this is for test purpose , in a production environment it will be good to choose yes and a strong password.
output

```bash
Securing the MySQL server deployment.

Connecting to MySQL using a blank password.

VALIDATE PASSWORD COMPONENT can be used to test passwords
and improve security. It checks the strength of password
and allows the users to set only those passwords which are
secure enough. Would you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD component?

Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No: n
Please set the password for root here.

New password:

Re-enter new password:
By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user,
allowing anyone to log into MySQL without having to have
a user account created for them. This is intended only for
testing, and to make the installation go a bit smoother.
You should remove them before moving into a production
environment.

Remove anonymous users? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y
Success.


Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from
'localhost'. This ensures that someone cannot guess at
the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y
Success.

By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that
anyone can access. This is also intended only for testing,
and should be removed before moving into a production
environment.


Remove test database and access to it? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y
 - Dropping test database...
Success.

 - Removing privileges on test database...
Success.

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes
made so far will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y
Success.

All done!
```

Next, run the command below

```bash
sudo mysql
```

output
```bash
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 10

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql>
```
Step 4 - Create user and database on Mysql Server

We now create remote user named user01 on the mysql prompt

```bash
CREATE USER 'user01'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password01';
```

output

```bash
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
```

Next, we create a database

```bash
CREATE DATABASE client_server_db;
```

output

```bash
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
```
Next we grant all priviledges on the database _client_server_ to the remote user _user01_.

```bash
GRANT ALL ON client_server_db.* TO 'user01'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

output

```bash
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

Next, we flush the privileges

```bash
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

output

```bash
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

and exit

```bash
exit
```
Step 5 - Configure MySQL Server to Allow Connections

Next, we configure the _mysql server_ to allow connection from remote hosts. We edit the bind-address and replace _127.0.0.1_ with _0.0.0.0

```bash
sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf 
```

![allow remote connection](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-client-server/img2.PNG?raw=true)

We then need to restart the mysql service

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mysql
```

Next, we now remotely connect to the _mysql server_ from _mysql client_ using _mysql_ utility.

We get the _mysql server_ IP address

```bash
ip addr show
```
output

```bash
...
172.31.62.42
```

```bash
sudo mysql -u user01 -h 172.31.62.42 -p
```

output

```sql
Enter password:

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement
```

Next, we check the databases

```sql
show databases;
```

output

```bash
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| client_server_db   |
| information_schema |
+--------------------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

Congratulations, we successfully deployed a MySQL client-server setup and able to connect to a mysql server from mysql client and perform mysql queries.
