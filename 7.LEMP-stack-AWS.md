# Web stack implementation using (LEMP Stack)

```bash
ssh -i C:\Users\Babatunde\Desktop\Downloads\pem\mysingular-EC2.pem ubuntu@52.87.232.212
```

## Step 1

We will use the poupular high-performance web server called Nginx to display our web pages. We will need to install _nginx_ using the _apt_ package manager. Type `Y` when propted to install.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

After installation we then verify if nginx was installed sucessfully.

```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

We should get output as below. This shows we have first installed a web server in the cloud!.

![nginx](./img-lemp-stack/img2.png)

To have access to our web server, we need to open port 80 for HTTP, on our security group. We already did this when we are setting up our EC2 ubumtu server.

![http-port80](./img-lemp-stack/img3.png).

## Using curl command to access our web server on port 80

```bash
curl http://localhost:80
```

Our output should be

```html
ubuntu@ip-172-31-59-22:~$ curl http://localhost:80
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
<style>
    body {
        width: 35em;
        margin: 0 auto;
        font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
    }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
<p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
working. Further configuration is required.</p>

<p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
```
We now test our nginx web server on the browser. Type below on the browser. Replave teh public IP with your own.

```bash 
http://52.87.232.212/
```
output

![http-port80](./img-lemp-stack/img4.png)

## Step 2 - Installing mySQL

We use _apt_ to acquire and install the mySQL and type `Y` when prompted.

Run command below
```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server
```

Next, it is recommended we install a security script that comes with MySQL, this will remove some insecure default settings and lock down access to the database.

Let run command below to start:

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

We will be asked to `VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN`

output

```bash
Securing the MySQL server deployment.

Connecting to MySQL using a blank password.

VALIDATE PASSWORD COMPONENT can be used to test passwords
and improve security. It checks the strength of password
and allows the users to set only those passwords which are
secure enough. Would you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD component?

Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No: Y

There are three levels of password validation policy:

LOW    Length >= 8
MEDIUM Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, and special characters
STRONG Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, special characters and dictionary                  file

Please enter 0 = LOW, 1 = MEDIUM and 2 = STRONG: 0
Please set the password for root here.

New password:

Re-enter new password:

Estimated strength of the password: 100
Do you wish to continue with the password provided?(Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y
By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user,
allowing anyone to log into MySQL without having to have
a user account created for them. This is intended only for
testing, and to make the installation go a bit smoother.
You should remove them before moving into a production
environment.

Remove anonymous users? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y
Success.


Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from
'localhost'. This ensures that someone cannot guess at
the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y
Success.

By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that
anyone can access. This is also intended only for testing,
and should be removed before moving into a production
environment.


Remove test database and access to it? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y
 - Dropping test database...
Success.

 - Removing privileges on test database...
Success.

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes
made so far will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y
Success.

All done!
```

Next, we test if we are able to login to the mySql

```bash
sudo mysql
```

output

```bash
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 10
Server version: 8.0.25-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 (Ubuntu)

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql>
```

As seen from the above output, we are able to login to the MySql as root, which is the database root user. This should not be confused with the ubuntu root user.

Type _exit_ command to exit mysql


```
output

```bash
mysql> exit
Bye
```

## Step 3 - Installing PHP
