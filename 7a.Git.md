# Introduction to Git

## Introduction

Git is a open source distributed version control system used to track files changes.
It is used by programmers to collaborate when developing source code in software developement. 

To follow along we will need to [install Git](https://git-scm.com/).


Step 1 - Install git on your PC

Step 2 - Create a Local Repository on our local PC

We first by creating a project folder on our PC, change directory into it and inilialize a git repository

```bash
mkdir testRepo
```

```bash
cd testRepo
```

```bash
git init
```

output

```bash
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Babatunde/Project/testRepo/.git/
```

Now, our testRepo is now a local git repositiory and any file or folder we add inside this folder will be tracked by git.

Next, create an a file named _index.html file in the testRepo folder.

```bash
touch index.html
```

Open the _index.html file with a text editor, here I am using vs code.

```bash
code .
```

Add the code below inside the _index.html_ file

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Gits</h1>

    <script>
const addNums = (a,b)=>{
    return a + b
};


console.log(addNums(5,6));

    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Now that , we have added _index.html_ file to our local git repo, and updated the _index.html_ file, the next this is that we want to save it to what is called a staging area. The staging area .This is where we are temporary adding and removing files that we want to be in our next commit. To do this we use the _git add filename_ as below.

```git
git add index.html
```

Nect we check what we just did.

```git
git status
```

output

```bash
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   index.html

```

Now that we have the _index.html_ file in the staging area, it is now time for us to commit it. We make a commit when we see that we have made progress with our work or achieved a milestone and will want to save at that point.


To commit our changes, we use command below. the -m stands for _message_ and inside the quote we describe our changes 

```git 
git commit -m "added index.html"
```

Next we check our changes

```git
git status
```

output

```git
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Let make a change to our _index.html_ file and see our we can commit the change.

Add the code below to replace the code in  _index.html_ file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Gits</h1>

    <script>
const addNums = (a,b)=>{
    return a + b
};

// console.log(addNums(5,6));
// add numbers in an array

const arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];

const addNumArr = ()=>{
   return arr.reduce((total, currentValue)=>{
      return total + currentValue
   })
}
console.log(addNumArr())
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
Next we check status of or local git repo

```bash 
git status
```

output

```bash
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   index.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```
It says we are on branch master and changes not staged yet, we do _git add index.html_ to add or _git add . _ , where the _dot_ means add every file that has changed.

```bash
git add .
```

We check for the status

```bash
git status
```

output

```bash
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   index.html

```

Nextm we commit our changes

```bash
git commit -m "updated index.html file"
```

output

```bash
$ git commit -m "updated index.html file"
[master 9a232f9] updated index.html file
 1 file changed, 23 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)

```

## Branching]

Next we want to do brandhing. let say I we want to create a new branch which is different from our master branch. Note that we are still working locally. We can later the merge our branch with the master branch.

Create a new branch, where _tutorial_ is the name of the branch.

```bash
git checkout -b tutorial
```

output

```bash
Switched to a new branch 'tutorial'
```

What we've done now is that we have branched off from our master branch to a new branch called _tutorial_ . We also copied everything in our master branch to this tutorial branch and any changes on this new branch will not affect our master branch .

Now, let make another change to our _index.html_ file. This change we now make is on our tutorial branch and does not affect our master branch .

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Gits</h1>

    <script>
const addNums = (a,b)=>{
    return a + b
};

// console.log(addNums(5,6));
// add numbers in an array

const arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];

// const addNumArr = ()=>{
//    return arr.reduce(getSum,0)
// }

// function getSum(total, currentValue){
//     return total + currentValue;
// }


const addNumArr = ()=>{
   return arr.reduce((total, currentValue)=>{
      return total + currentValue
   })
}
console.log(addNumArr());

// looping an array
arr.forEach((element)=>{
    console.log(element)
})

    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Checking our changes

```bash
git status
```

output

```bash
On branch tutorial
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   index.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```

Notice , it says on tutorial branch.

Next we add our change to the staging area, then we later commit it.

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git commit -m "initial commit for tutorial"
```

output

```bash
[tutorial e322b8f] initial commit for tutorial
 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)

```

We will checout to the master branch to check if the file changes.

```bash
git checkout master
```
output

```bash
Switched to branch 'master'
```

If you notice our _index.html_ file does not contain the _looping array code_, because it was made on the tutorial branch. The tutoral branch is now ahead of the master branch because it has new changes.

```javascript
// looping an array
arr.forEach((element)=>{
    console.log(element)
})
```

Now let create a new file named _test.py_ . Remember we are still on the master branch .

```bash 
touch test.py
```

Add the code to test.py

```python
def sayHello():
    print('Hello everyone!')

sayHello()
```

Next we add our changes to the staging area and commit it.
Check status

```bash
git status
```

output

```bash
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        test.py

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git commit -m "added a new file"
```

output

```bash
[master f1eaec6] added a test.py and a function
 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 test.py
```

Now let, checkout to _tutorial branch_

```bash
git checkout tutorial
```

If you notice, our folder testRepo does not longer conatin the _test.py_ because it was created in the master branch and now that we have switched to teh _tutorial branch_ it does not longer show.

Now, let us now merge what we have in the _tutorial branch_ with what we have one the _master branch_ . This will bring the change on our _master branch_ to the _tutorial branch_ .

```bash
git merge master
```

output

```bash
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 test.py | 4 ++++
 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 test.py
```

Now if we notice we now have the test.py file. Now to have the _looping an array_ that is n=on the _tutorial branch_ with the _master branch_, we will switch back to the master branch and merge also.

```bash
git checkout master
```

output

```bash
Switched to branch 'master'
```
Now, if you notice on the index.html we do not have the _looping array code_ .

## Remote Git Repo

Next, we create a remote git repo in the cloud and make our fiels saved there.

First, we need to signup for a free account on github [here](https://github.com/). I have already done that, and create a new git repoistory.

We create a new repository and call it _git_tutorial_ and choose _public_ and click create repository.

![repo](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-git/img1.PNG?raw=true)

Next we get this

![repo](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-git/img2.PNG?raw=true)

Next, we will add the code below . What we are doing is add the url to the remote repository. The code below is the url of the repository we just created, you can copy yours.

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/thinkC/git_tutorial.git
```

Next we will push changes to this new remote repository.

Let first check what branch we are, because we want to be on the master branch before we push to the remote repo.

```bash
git checkout master
```

output

```bash
Already on 'master'
```

We are pushing all our commit to the origin master

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

output

```bash
Enumerating objects: 9, done.
Counting objects: 100% (9/9), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (7/7), done.
Writing objects: 100% (9/9), 1.15 KiB | 73.00 KiB/s, done.

remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), done.
To https://github.com/thinkC/git_tutorial.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master

```

Refreshing our github page we now have our files on the remote repository.

![remote repo](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-git/img3.PNG?raw=true)

## Pulling from a remote repository

If we want to pull from a remote repository, here I created a readme.md file and added some text. I then wrote a commit message that I added a new readme file and click on commit changes.

![pull from remote repo](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-git/img4.png?raw=true)

![pull from remote repo](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-git/img5.PNG?raw=true)

Next, we see how we can get this change from the remote repository from our command line .

```bash
git pull origin master
```

output
```bash
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), 713 bytes | 24.00 KiB/s, done.
From https://github.com/thinkC/git_tutorial
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
   f1eaec6..a7d9279  master     -> origin/master
Updating f1eaec6..a7d9279
Fast-forward
 README.md | 2 ++
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
```

Now , when we go to our folder _testRepo_ and do and `ls` command we will see that it pulled the _Readme.md_ file from the remote repository.

```bash
ls
```
output

```bash
README.md  index.html  test.py
```

## Simulating a conflict

On the remote repo readme.md file I another _This is another test_ on line 3 and commit changes.

![git repo](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-git/img6.PNG?raw=true)

On the readMe.md file on my PC I added text as below. 

![local file](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-git/img7.PNG?raw=true)

Now add changes to the staging area and commit. Make sure were are still on branch master.

```
git checkout master
git status
git add .
git commit -m "added new text to local readMe file"
```

output

```bash
Already on 'master'
M       README.md

...
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

...
[master f800ea1] added new text to local readMe file
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)


```

Next, we will push from local repo to remote repo. Let see what happens since I don't have the new change on the remote readMe.md file here on the local readMe.md file.

```bash
git push origin master
```


And we get the error below

```bash
To https://github.com/thinkC/git_tutorial.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/thinkC/git_tutorial.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

To fix this we need to first pull the changes on the remote repo to our local repo

```bash
git pull origin master
```

output
```bash
remote: Enumerating objects: 5, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0

Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

Notice what is said about _Automatic merge failed..._ . The pull request was able to pull the changes to the local repo, but found some conflicts which we need to fix manually before we can see the change on our PC. The reason we have a conflict was because we changed same line and git does not know what to keep, so we delete manually

![conflict repo](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-git/img8.PNG?raw=true)

Here I will accept changes from the remote repo which is teh incoming change . You can play around this and see what you want to keep and discard or if you wanty to keep both.

Save the readMe.md file and add change to staging area.

```bash
git status
```

output
```bash
On branch master
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
        both modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git status
```

output
```bash
$ git status
On branch master
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:
        modified:   README.md

```

```bash
git commit -m "fixed conflict"
```

output

```bash
[master 14189e7] fixed conflict
```

Check status again

```bash
git status
```

output

```bash
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

```bash
git push origin master
```
output
```bash
Enumerating objects: 8, done.
Counting objects: 100% (8/8), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.

To https://github.com/thinkC/git_tutorial.git
   6393b09..14189e7  master -> master

```

Next, we push the _tutorial branch_ to the remote repo. First, we checkout to the new branch.

```bash
git checkout tutorial
```

output
```bash
Switched to branch 'tutorial'
```

Next, we push this branch to the remote repo.

```bash
git push origin tutorial
```
output
```bash
Enumerating objects: 9, done.
Counting objects: 100% (8/8), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.

remote:

 * [new branch]      tutorial -> tutorial
```

We are now able to push our _tutorial branch_ to the remote repo.

![tutorial branch](https://github.com/thinkC/devops-projects/blob/master/img-git/img9.PNG?raw=true)

In this example we do not need to compare and pull request, the compare and pull request can be closed.

We successfully learnt about git fundametals.
